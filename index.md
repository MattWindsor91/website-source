# OCaml Software Foundation

![logo, by [Bettina Steinbrecher](https://bettystein.com/)](img/logo-ocsf.png)

The OCaml Software Foundation is a (non-profit) foundation whose
mission is to promote, protect, and advance the [OCaml programming
language](ocaml.org) and its ecosystem, and to support and facilitate
the growth of a diverse and international community of OCaml users.

We collects donations from our sponsors, companies, entities or people
interested in growing the OCaml programming language, and
redistribute these resources to grow, support and strengthen the OCaml
community.

# Some of our recent actions

- Fund internships to advance the OCaml ecosystem and also grow new
  OCaml contributors.

  + Two [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internships to
    improve our testing of the OCaml compiler and language tools.

  + A research internship on type inference, to study approaches to
    keep the type-checker predictable and robust as the language evolves.

  + Two development internships on our teaching platform.

- Evolve the [Learn-OCaml](http://learn-ocaml.hackojo.org/) exercise
  platform and facilitate its adoption by teachers.

  + We have provided financial support to some early-adopters of the
    Learn-OCaml platform (McGill university).

  + We are funding teachers to grow a [shared
    corpus](https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml-corpus) of
    high-quality exercises.

  + We are funding the continuous technical development of the
    [platform software](https://github.com/ocaml-sf/learn-ocaml) --
    entirely free software, developing features as suggested by
    its usage in classrooms.

  + We provide financial support to run new editions of the [OCaml
    MOOC](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:parisdiderot+56002+session03/about),
    open to everyone.
