## Past and current actions

### Supporting OCaml teaching

The foundation has invested funding and effort (in particular through
the work of Yann Régis-Gianas, teaching representative on the
Executive Board) in the Learn-OCaml technical platform for online
exercises, which powers the OCaml MOOC and several OCaml courses in
university.

We are interested in supporting other technical platforms that allow
teaching OCaml to a wide audience, in a school/academic setting or for
self-learning; we would also like to grow an open corpus of teaching
and learning material, and support in-boarding actions towards
non-OCaml programmers.

Our past actions for OCaml teaching include:

- running sessions of the OCaml MOOC in 2018-2019
  (3k registrants, 200 certificates)

  + employed one TA to help students on the MOOC forums

- relicensing (MIT) and further development of the Learn-OCaml platform

  + funded more development of the platform by OCamlPro

  + employed two interns to write documentation for teachers
  (platform, exercise-writing...) and review pedagogical material

- corpus development: call to everyone (still ongoing)

  + received 10 high-quality advanced exercices from François Pottier

  + 40 exercises from the MOOC

- teacher communication: wide discussions with OCaml teachers and
  potential adopters

  + financial support for a CS-Teaching conference at the French
    national level

  + presentation at the OCaml Workshop last year

- financial support for first-year Learn-OCaml courses

  + First-year course at Paris-Diderot.

  + Switching McGill's intro-to-programming course to the Learn-OCaml
    platform. (See the Experience Report at ICFP 2019).


Ongoing work in progress includes:

- an instance server where teachers can easily create a new
  Learn-OCaml instance for their course without having to self-host it

- widening the corpus of exercises, connecting it with
  publicly-available teaching material


### General OCaml actions

- Financial support for the ReasonML association.

- Support community events

  + sponsored video-capture for the Paris OCaml meetup
    (if you would like to run a regular meetup in another
     city, feel free to get in touch!)

- Funded two [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) internships to
  improve our testing of the OCaml compiler and language tools,
  while participating in improving the diversity in the OCaml community.

- Funded a research internship on type inference, to study approaches to
  keep the type-checker predictable and robust as the language evolves.

- Funded OCaml language research and compiler development.
