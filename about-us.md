# The people behind the Foundation

The actions of the OCaml Software Foundation are directed by an
Executive Committee which currently consists of

- [Damien Doligez](http://pauillac.inria.fr/~doligez/)
  (advisor)
- [Xavier Leroy](https://xavierleroy.org/)
  (advisor)
- [Yann RÃ©gis-Gianas](http://yann.regis-gianas.org/)
  (representative of the teaching community)
- [Gabriel Scherer](http://gasche.info/) (president)

We work with the help of an Advisory Board populated by
representatives of our [sponsors](sponsors.md). It is a forum to share
information among industrial users of OCaml and active members of the
community, to identify and discuss priorities and pain points in the
OCaml community that the Foundation can help with.

Magali Fitzgibbon and Norma Caillot, employees of the INRIA
Foundation, provide the administrative and legal support that make our
actions possible.
